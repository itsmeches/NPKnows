ASGI config for bitter_gourd_health project.

This file configures the ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) for the bitter_gourd_health project.
ASGI serves as the interface between Django and asynchronous web servers and enables Django to handle asynchronous tasks, 
such as WebSockets or long-running background tasks.

The application is exposed as a module-level variable named `application`.
